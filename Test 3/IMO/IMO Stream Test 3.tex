\item %G3
Let $O$ be the circumcentre of an acute scalene triangle $ABC$. Line $OA$ intersects the altitudes of $ABC$ through $B$ and $C$ at $P$ and $Q$ respectively. The altitudes meet at $H$. Prove that the circumcentre of triangle $PQH$ lies on a median of triangle $ABC$.


\item %N2
Let $p \geq 2$ be a prime number. Lauren and Dylan play the following game making moves alternately: in each move, the current player chooses an index $i$ in the set $\{0, 1, \dotsc, p-1\}$ that was not chosen before by either of the two players and then chooses an element $a_i$ of the set $\{0, 1, \dotsc, 9\}$. Lauren has the first move. The game ends after all the indices $i \in \{0, 1, \dotsc, p-1\}$ have been chosen. Then the following number is computed:
\[ M = a_0 +10\cdot a_1 +\dotsb +10^{p-1} \cdot a_{p-1} = \sum_{j=0}^{p-1} a_j \cdot 10^j. \]
Lauren's goal is to make the number $M$ divisible by $p$, and Dylan's goal is to prevent this.

Prove that Lauren has a winning strategy.


\item %A4
A sequence of real numbers $a_1, a_2, \dotsc$ satisfies the relation
\[ a_n = - \max_{i+j=n}(a_i+a_j) \qquad\textrm{for all } n > 2017. \]
Prove that this sequence is bounded, i.e., there is a constant $M$ such that $\left|a_n\right| \leq M$ for all positive integers $n$.
