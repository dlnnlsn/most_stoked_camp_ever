Suppose that $\omega$ is the circumcircle of the triangle $ABC$ with $AC>AB$. Let $X$ and $Y$ be two points on $AC$ and circle $\omega$ respectively, such that $CX = CY = AB$. (The points $A$ and $Y$ lie on different sides of the line passing through $B$ and $C$). The line $XY$ intersects $\omega$ for the second time in point $P$. Show that $PB=PC$.

A rectangle $R$ with odd integer side lengths is divided into small rectangles with integer side lengths. Prove that there is at least one among the small rectangles whose distances from the four sides of $R$ are either all odd or all even.\\

\item %N3

Determine all integers $n \geq 2$ with the following property: for any integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ whose sum is not divisible by $n$, there exists an index $1 \leq i \leq n$ such that none of the numbers $$a_i, \ a_i+a_{i+1}, \ \dots, \ a_i+a_{i+1}+\dots a_{i+n-1}$$ is divisible by $n$. (We let $a_i = a_{i-n}$ where $i>n$.)\\
